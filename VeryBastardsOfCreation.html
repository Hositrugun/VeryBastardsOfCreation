<p>The author of eight books, including <i>The Rousing of the Scottish Working Class (1979), Making Trouble (1987), Socialism Since 1889: A Briographical History (1988) and John Maclean (1992)</i>, James D. Young is a veteran radical and advocate of socialism from below. Before he took ill in 1990 and was forced into premature 'retirement', he was a Reader in History at the University of Stirling.
</p><p>Dr. Young taught Scottish working-class history at Stirling and agitated socialism and the Scottish question for almost a quarter of a century. Although he has lectured in America, Austria, Israel and Ireland and travelled extensively, he has spent most of his life in or around the Falkirk/Grangemouth axis.
</p><p>The national Chariperson of the John Maclean Society, oung is working on a new book <i>The World of C.L.R. James: The Unfragmented Vision.</i> Like the great English socialist Tom Mann, he hopes to grow more dangerous as he grows older. He believes that the Western world is now living through a period of sloth, reaction and counter-revolution; and as someone who stands in 'the tradition of Scottish flyting,' he looks forward to Scottish independence.

<p>James D. Young is a man apart. He has eschewed the bureaucratic time-serving which characterises so much of Scottish higher education in order to purseu his own academic quest. He is unashamedly a man of the Left, and he remains so, honestly and defiantly, at a time when so many of his erstwhile fellow leftists have shed their beliefs with pitiful if bewildering rapidity.
</p><p>James Young would probably regard me as being at best a cynical hack, at worst a bourgeois conformist, and I was both flattered and surprised when he asked me to write the introduction to this, his latest book. But he knows that I respect his intellectual integrity and his zealous pursuit of the real history of his country.
</p><p>Young and I first got to know each other in the very different decade of the 1970s. Since then our paths have crossed from time to time and I have always enjoyed arguing and conversing with him. I have also been able to commission some of his articles and essays for both <i>The Herald</i> and the <i>Scotsman</i> and I regard this as a privilege.
</p><p>We first encountered each other because of our mutual regard for the great reforming head teacher R.F. Mackenzie. When I was covering education for the <i>Scotsman</i> in the early 1970s Mackenzie was without doubt the outstanding figure around. I am happy to record that Young's assessement of Mackenzie in this book is by far the finest I have ever read.
</p><p>If Mackenzie has for me pride of place in Young's pantheon of great Scottish radicals that is probably just because I was lucky enough to know him personally. There are other familiar names here - Keir Hardie is perhaps the most famous, though as Young lucidly explains, analysis of his career has too often been perverted by the need of English (and Welsh) historians to filter their judgments through their London and Parliament-dominated world view. There is, alas, no parochialism like English left-wing parochialism (unless it is English right-wing parochialism).
</p><p>Here also is Lewis Grassic Gibbon, arguably the best Scottish novelist of our Century, and as Young forcibly reminds us, a writer of unremitting and extreme radicalism. But for me this book served as an introduction to other much less celebrated Scottish figures such as the poet and essayist James MacFarlan. I hope that many other readers will be as fascinated and moved as I was to read of such men, of their sturggles and words and deeds.
</p><p>James Young is a combative and exciting historian. Reading his work is stimulating in all sorts of ways, but it is especially salutary for three reasons. First, Young understands the importance of literature. He is constantly quoting novelists and poets. In Scotland we have a supremely fecund and controversial literary tradition, but too many of our historians ignore this most rewarding of sources. It is a truism that good writers of fiction often tell the truth about their times in a way that writers of non-fiction simply cannot, but it appears to be a truism often ignored by many Scots historians.
</p><p>Secondly, Young does not understimate the sheer forcing significance of personality. His treatment of history in this book is unashamedly personal and biographical, and all the more apposite for that. Furthermore, his biographical approach makes his history available and readable. Young is, in the best sense, a popular historian.
</p><p>And thirdly, he is unusual for a British historian in that he is quite prepared to bypass the great institutions such as Parliament and the Empire and thus ignore the 'system' that so often allows history to be written by, for and about the 'winners'. But as we read this book we learn that it is indeed more subtle than that: the race is not to the swift, and if we look at history through less orthodox perspectives, we soon see that conventional notions of 'winning' are trite and false.
</p><p>I have emphasised that this book is strong meat. Young cannot abide writing that is anodyne. He himself could not write a bromide if he tried. His book will irritate many on the Left - perhaps more on the Left than on the Right. I hope that all Young's intellectual enemies bestir themselves and read it. They might be angered by they will also be enlightened.
</p><p>James Young has mastered the Scottish technique of flyting. But much more than that: he has exposed much modern Scottish historiography as a genteel sham. The radicals who blaze across his pages are red-blooded and intelligent men, forceful and gutsy, working and pushing and writing for change, real change. They cannot be fitted into any neat, safe theories.
</p><p>James Young writes about a country in which intellectual and political quarrels used to be bitter. We live in a more bland age, an age in which too much of political and academic life has been taken over by ambitious nonentities and politically correct cretins. Young is breathing fire back into our intellectual life. For him, the interpetation of our past is a matter of bitter partisanship. Yet he himself is not a bitter man. He has an angry pen but a generous spirit, and it is this splendid combination of anger and generosity which makes this book so valuable.

<p>Though the Union of Parliaments of 1707 had played a major role in shaping later Scottish consciousness, the really seminal year in the history of modern Scotland was 1688 rather than 1707. Indeed, when they looked back to the past, many of the Scottish radicals depicted in <i>The Very Bastards of Creation</i>, and particularly James Thomson Callender and Alexander Robertson or 'Dondonachie', saw the year 1688 as the year of tragedy and setback for Scotland. So, although the Scottish radicalism protrayed in this book is focused on the period from the second half of the eighteenth century onwards, the radicals own reference point was 1688, not 1707. Unfortunately, the modern 'internationalist' Left as a whole remains ignorant of and often indifferent to Scottish history.
</p><p>At a meeting of the John MacLean Society in Glasgow in November 1993, I was caught up in a political argument with Tommy Sheridan of Scottish Militant Labour and Paul Smith, a pro-English Marxist. Smith's Marxism consists of, in John Carstairs Matheson's immortal phrase, 'internationalism as a sort of international jingoism.' I responded to their anti-Scottish comments by blurting out that 'I am proud to belong to a Scottish radical tradition that is much older than Marxism'. Smith, who was learning some Scottish words, retorted: 'Yes! But it is a <i>carnaptious</i> tradition.' It was inevitable that some of my critics would subsequently say - in the <i>sleekit</i> tradition of the petty gossips, or 'the bodies' or Greek chorus in George Douglas Brown's anti-Kailyard novel <i>The House with the Green Shutter</i> - that I had renounced Marxism.
</p><p>Though accidentally perceptive, Smith's comment forced me to recognise that Scottish radicalism has been <i>carnaptious</i> from the eighteenth century onwards. As I thought about this accusation, it occurred to me that there had been powerful cultural reasons for turning Scottish radicalism and radicals into a <i>carnaptious</i> (or quarrelsome) political force. The important thing about this encounter with Sheridan and Smith is that it gave me the energy to look at Scottish history anew in the light of the highly civilised and polite 'middle-class' culture of the Scottish Enlightenment and the 'internatlist' Left.
</p><p>Despite the ruling classes' recent world-wide counter-revolution, Marxism remains undefeated. Moreover, although this book on the history of the Scots as <i>The Very Bastards of Creations: Scottish-International Radicalism: A Biographical HIstory, 1688-1995</i> - a title inspired by the anti-Scottish English radical, John Wiles - is pro-Scottish, anti-capitalist and committed to the aspiration of authentic socialist internationalism, it derives its inspiration from the author's own lifelong activity inside the labour movement and inside anti-Stalinist groups. Though <i>The Very Bastards of Creation</i> is coloured by Marx's conception of radicalism, it is implicitly hostiel to Stalinism and all forms of authoritarian socialism from above.
</p><p>Unknown to many of the authoritarians of the Left, classical marxism was inherently libertarian and democratic. Moreover, even before Marx became an advocate of working-class men and women's struggle for democratic socialist (class) struggle from below, he was a radical. However, although he was a radical whose very earliest ideas about radicalism had lodged themselves into the core of classical Marxism, what he said was quite compatible with the cultural history of Scottish radicalism from the eitheenth century onwards. It was in an article written in 1844 that the young Marx insisted that: 'To be radical is to take the matter by the root. And as far as mankind is concerned, the root is man himself.'
</p><p>In an article in <i>The Observer</i> in March 1995 titled 'Doomed by the albatross of Englishness', Melanie Philips asserted that 'the Scottish Enlightenment helped define Scotland.' But, although the Anglo-Scottish ruling class most certainly helped to define their idea of 'Scotland', the eiteenth-century Scotland of the common folk - radical artisans, farm labourers and peasants - existed in opposition to the Anglo-Scots Scottish Enlightenment. In fact, the London-inspired <i>British</i> consciousness of the Scottish Enlightenment existed in bitter and hostile opposition to the <i>carnaptious</i> radical culture of consciousness of an older Scotland and of the common people. From 'the glorious [English] revolution' of 1688 onwards, there were at least two Scotlands.
</p><p>When I was an eleven-and-twelve-year old school boy in a secondary school in the Scottish town of Grangemouth in 1942 and 1943, I encountered two teachers of history. One was Miss MacPhee, M.A., who tried to force me to read Walter Scott's novel <i>Old Mortality</i>, and the other was the wonderful Miss Smith, who taught her pupils that Scotland had been sold out in 1707. A much better and more democratic human being than MacPhee, Smith told generations of schoolboys that a 'parcel of rogues' had signed away Scotland's ancient nationhood as 'the whole of the Scottish population were held back by English soldiers.'
</p><p>As a twelve-year-old, I did wonder about how the whole of the Scottish population managed to get to Edinburgh in 1707 when they could not afford the journey in the 1940s. Nevertheless, as I grew up and studied Scottish history, I realised that Smith's basic point was valid - the Scots had objected to losing their freedom to a superior English imperialism. Although a better story-teller than a historian, she was also a product of the Scottish radical tradition. As I grew into manhood, she gave me obscure books and encouraged my unworldly ambition to become a historian. Her influence on me was immeasureable, and I did not forget 'wee Miffy', as we called her with great affection. But she always insisted on the importance of asking awkward, difficult, critical and heretical questions.
</p><p>As a result of Miss Smith's influence and my own discovery of the <i>Communist Manifesto</i> in 1948, I have spent my adult life struggling to understand from a genuinely democratic standpoint the history of the relationship between nationalism and a futuristic socialist internationalism. When I met Smith in Lumsley Street, Grangemout, on my way home from working as a labourer in a local sawmill on a summer's evening in 1947, she advised me to get Lewis Grassic Gibbon's novel, <i>A Scots Quair</i>.
</p><p>Thus 104 years after Karl Marx made his well-known remark about what it meant to be a radical, I discovered and read the <i>Communist manifesto</i> of 1848. By 1948, when I was a seventeen-year-old railway worker, the discovery of the <i>Manifesto</i> by Marx and Engels changed my life for ever. The explosive intellectual impact on my already strong Scottish radical consciousness of the ideas of the materialist conception of history and the crucial role of the class struggle in history forced me to see the world in new and unforeseen ways. Before I reached the last page, I knew that I would never be the same again. I wish I could convey the powerful and irresistible appeal of the <i>Communist Manifesto</i> of 1848 on a young unskilled Scottish industrial worker a hundred years after its first publication in various languages. But memory has always been deceptive, and historians are aware of the pitfalls of 'inventive memory'. Even now, it is one of the books I would want to have with me if I should end up on a desert island.
</p><p>Although I did not have the words - or the language - to express my reservations about <i>the Communist Manifesto's</i> dismissal of the concepts of national identity and national character, the appeal of the closing words were irresistable.
</p><p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Working men of all countries unite. 
</p><p>Indeed, all of my subsequent writings (including several books on national and international working-class history) have constituted a silent, and hitherto unacknowledged, dialogue with the Marx and Engels who wrote the <i>Communist Manifesto.</i>
</p><p>Before going on to discuss the nature of my reservations over the analysis of the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>, I want to stress that, in my opinion, the greatness of Marx resided in his attitude to life itself. When John Swinton (1829-1901), the Scottish-born American radical journalist, interviewed him at Ramsgate, England, in 1880, Marx revealed his closeness to the old Scottish saying, 'The Truth against the World.' Towards the end of his interview, Swinton wrote:
</p><p style="margin-Left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
Over the thought of the babblement and rack of the age and the ages, over the talk of the day and the scenes of the evening, arose in my mind one question touching upon the final law of being, for which I would seek an answer from this sage. Going down to the depth of language, and rising to the height of emphasis, during an interspace of silence, I interrogated the revolutionist and philosopher in these fateful words:
<br> What Is?
<br> And it seemed as though his mind were inverted for a moment while he looked upon the roaring sea in front and the restless multitude upon the beach. 'What is it?' I had inquired, to which, in deep and solemn tone, he replied 'Struggle!'
</p><p> And the constancy of struggle - or perhaps even permanent opposition - was central to Marx's conception of 'progress'. 
</p><p> Moreover, as a schoolboy during the Second World War - a schoolboy whose parents were involved in the struggle against fascism - the world of the Scottish Enlightenment as I encountered it through the novels of Walter Scott was alien to my own outlook. But in the air-raid shelters of Grangemouth my father argued for John Maclean and 'the Revolution', while my mother, who distrusted all elites and would-be elites, was already preparing for the punters' opposition when the Revolution came.
</p><p> It was a far better education than the University education that the father of the famous socialist Victor Serge had called the 'stupid bourgeois instruction of the poor'. Meanwhile I read all the socialist classics that I could get my hands on, though I kept returning to the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>. The thing that disturbed me most was the statement that 'modern industrial labour, modern subjugation to capital, the in England as in France, in America as in German, has stripped him [the worker] of every trace of national character.' It was not true in 1848, and it is sadly and tragically less true in the 1990s. In its traditional form, it is perhaps not even valid as an aspiration. 
</p><p> Being cursed with the possession of the ever-questioning and nagging historian's turn of mind, I have spent the past four decades almost unwittingly turning my mind back to my own early experiences in the 1930s and 1940s and the beginnings of my real education at newbattle Abbey College, Dalkeith, and Ruskin College, Oxford in the early 1950s. At Newbattle, Edwin Muir introduced me to the history of <i>Another Scotland</i> that I had not hitherto encountered anywhere else. At Oxford, I was given a copy of the late G.D.H. Cole's and Raymond Postgate's book <i>The Common People (1938)</i>. And Cole more than anyone else is responsible for sustaining the motivation to research and write <i>The Very Bastards of Creation</i>.
</p><p> Although Cole began with the Scots very traumatic experience of Culloden in 1746, in searching for the origins of Scottish Radicalism in our hidden cultural history I have been forced to glance back to the consequences of the Union of Scotland and England in 1707. Despite Marx's denigration of Fletcher of Saltoun, and despite my own endorsement of many of Marx's criticism of this particular Scot, I have been forced to acknowledge Fletcher as a sort of radical who challenged 'the parcel of rogues' in the Scottish nation. Opposing those who sold out Scotland's independence for 'English gold', he displayed some of the virtues of Scottish cultural radicalism. But, although I have also tried to restore Robert Freguson (1750-1774), the Edinburgh poet, as a Scottish radical, <i>The Very Bastards of Creation</i> focuses on the hidden cultural-cum-radical history of Scotland from 1745 onwards. 
</p><p> During the years between 1707 and the battle of Culloden in 1746, Lowland as well as Highland Scots were estranged from the Establishment in London. The Scots silent, sullen resentment and effective disenfranchisenment from British Parliamentary politics, together with the inherited cultural traditions of a primitive egalitarianism, helped to create a mood of disaffection. This mood was, moreover, reinforced at various moments after 1707 by the arrest and transportation of Jacobites to jails in England. The mass transporation of rebellious Scots to jails in London after the Jacobites' defeat at Culloden deepened the existing mood of estrangement and disaffection. 
</p><p> My discovery of John Wilkes's assertion that the Scots were <i>The Very Bastards of Creation</i> - bastards who were incapable of becoming radicals because they were 'Jacobiets and foreigners' - led me to see those same Jacobites as very real opponents of English imperialism. In doing so, it reinforced my decades-old belief that the very difficult history of the relationship between nationalism and socialist internationalism itself needs to be rewritten.
</p><p> In his fine introduction to the <i>Conference Papers</i> given at Ruskin College, Oxford, in March 1995 on 'Scottish Dimensions', Raphael Samuel argued that: 'British history courses, even when they are called British, remain resolutely Anglocentric, in fact if not in name, and it comes as something of a shock to realise that so popular a book as Cole and Postage <i>The Common People, 1746-1938</i>, a great primer for the labour history of yesteryear and a foundation text for the idea of "history from below" dates the starting point of modern Britain, and the opening year of their own book, from the defeat of the clans at Culloden.' Furthermore, there was no disapproval expressed over the role of 'Butcher' Cumberland's modern English imperialist army in smashing an ancient way of life. 
</p><p> No thoughtful Scottish radical historian could ignore the role of Culloden on later Scottish consciousness. But in an exceptionally interesting footnote to his article on <i>Scottish Dimensions</i>, Samuel said:
</p><p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
It is interesting that G.D.H.Cole was [in 1938] becoming increasingly involved with rehabilitating the reputation of William Cobbett (the critical bibliography of his work, compiled by Maurice Pearl, was undertaken under Cole's aegis); [and] it is possible that for all his left-wing socialist sympathies, he was also touched by the idea of Tory radicalism.
</p><p> The argument for 'Butcher' Cumberland's progressive historical role at Culloden in 1746 was presented by Cole and Postgate with crystal clarity - Bonnie Prince Charlie had dared to march into [the new capitalist] England 'with, in the language of Marxian economics, a feudal army.'
</p><p> English radicals like John Wilkes, William Cobbett, Jack Wade and Richard Carlile will be seen in a less positive light in the pages of <i>The Very Bastards of Creation</i> than G.D.H. Cole and E.P. Thompson saw them. If they denigrated and dismissed the Scots radical potential, they did not understand the continuing impact of Culloden on the consciousness of the majority of Scots. In his study of international folk literature titled <i>The Horn Book (1970)</i>, George Legman wrote:
</p><p> There operates in Scotland (as elswhere), a most important sociological fact, which, though examples of it are not difficult to observe, I do not recollect having seen formulated in print. And that is the petrifying but protective influence of great military defeats. As the Scots themselves are the first to recognise, the whole cultural and political life of Scotland is still, basically, attuned to no later period than the mid- or later-nineteenth century, except in the neo-Marxist atmosphere of Glasgow and the industrial area, which has entirely jumped from the nineteenth century into the present, owing to the industrial blight. 
</p><p> Poets, novelists and literary folk have always had sharper insights into national 'peculiarities' than politicians. Therefore this history of <i>The Very Bastards of Creation</i> since 1688 has been cast in a biographical form with the focus on writers, poets and radical dreamers; and it has been indirectly influenced by some of Legman's insights.
</p><p> However, Legman's recognition of the continuing importance of Culloden on Scottish imaginative literature and consciousness after 1746 has been hidden by the unsubstantiated assertions of the Scottish historians Christopher Harvie and Tom Nairn about the unmitigated <i>Black</i> and reactionary nature of modern Scotland. Ignoring the formidable importance of 1688 and 1745 in Scottish history, and etching out his own argument - an argument quickly endorsed by the Scottish 'Marxist', Tom Nairn - of the nature of Scotland between 1707 and the present, Harvie wrote:
</p><p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
For the uniqueness of Scotland lies in the power of a <i>civil society</i> divorced from political nationalism, and in an intelligentsia which, lacking a political centre, was divided between two loyalties: The Red and the Black. The Red Scots were cosmopolitan, self-avowedly enlightened and, given a chance, authoritarian, expanding into and exploiting bigger and more bountiful fields than their own country could provide. Back home lurked their Black brothers, demotic, parochial and reactionary, but keeping the ladder of social promotion open, resisting the encroachments of the English governing class.  
</p><p> As I have discovered and rediscovered in countless University seminars and in the workers' halls and meeting places, where I feel more at ease, Harvey's suppression and rubbishing of the actual history of radical and socialist Scotland is exceptionally difficult to challenge. 
</p><p> Motivated by a moral commitment to the struggle for radical and socialist goals from 1688 onwards, <i>The Very Bastards of Creation</i> seeks to offer an alternative way of seeing the cultural history of Scottish radicalism and socialism between 1688 and 1995. By reconstructing the lives and times of James Thomson Callender (1758-1803), Alexander Rodger (1784-1846), James MacFarlan (1832-1862), Alexander Robertson (1825-1893), John Murdoch (1818-1903), Keir Hardie (1856-1915), John Maclean (1879-1923), Lewis Grassic Gibbon (1901-1935), James Barke (1905-1958), A.S. Neill (1883-1973) and R.F. Mackenzie (1910-1987), an alternative and anti-authoritarian Marxist history of those and many other radicals and socialists will be seen from an <b>internationalist</b> perspective. But <i>this book</i> has been energised by my own <i>worries</i> over the history of the often hidden relationship betwen nationalism and socialist internationalism inside various labour movements from the 1880s onwards.
</p><p> The First World War resulted in fascism and the Holocaust; and the German socialists' heroic resistance to fascism has been written out of history. Moreover, since the 1930s the world's peoples have lived through, in Joseph Buttinger's fine phrase, 'the twilight of socialism.' Millions of human beings are now confronted with the choice of 'socialism or barbarism', and the prospects for the Left ought to be very positive. In celebrating the collarpse of the fundamentally anti-socialist countries in Russia an dEastern Europe in 1989, historians of the libertarian Left have a duty to challenge the simplistic hagiography of institutionalised 'history' by probing into the less heroic and less inspiring aspects of labour history. Moreover, the rediscovery of the 'nationalism' - or complex dual and triple identities - of socialists like Eleanor Marx - could help to put international socialism back on the agenda. 
</p><p> Before socialism was forced into the twilight in the 1930s, working people in many countries developed dual identities and individual socialists developed multi-identities. Stalinism did enormous intellectual damage to classical socialism; it almost snuffed out the assumption that the way individuals saw themselves was part of their social being. In the 1880s, according to Eduard Bernstein, Eleanor Marx took every opportunity to say with pride: 'I am a Jewess.' 'How often', he wrote 'have I heard her shout it to the crowd, from the tribune.' She also told Max Beer that 'my happiest moments are when I am in the East End amidst Jewish work-people.'
</p><p> Furthermore, when James Connolly, the Irish socialist, was speaking at a meeting of the De Leonist Socialist Labour Party in Falkirk at the beginning of the century, he responded to a hostile question from the crowd by admitting that he was a Roman Catholic. Explaining why he could not be an orthodox socialist, Bell recalled: 'How is it possible', I asked, 'to reconcile the Catholicism of Rome with the materialist conception of history?' 'Well,' he replied, 'it is like this. In Ireland all the Protestants are Orangemen and howling jingoes. If the children go to Protestant schools they get taugh to wave the Union Jack and worship the English king. If they go to the Catholic Church they become rebels. Which would you sooner have?'
</p><p> Bell was, of course, defending what Eric J. Hobsbawm would subsequently describe as 'anti-fascist nationalism' of the Stalinist variety as 'a <i>new kind</i> of internationalism.'
</p><p> By 1937 Leon Trotsky, who was to slightly misquote George Bernard Shaw, 'the prince of internationalists', could not avoid recognising the difficult relationship between nationalism and socialist internationalism. As he put it: 'During my youth I rather leaned towards the prognosis that the Jewish question could thus disappear, as it were, automatically. The historical development of the last quarter of a century has not confirmed this view.' Moreover, the American writer Irving Howe (1983) wrote:
</p><p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
Had American socialism not reached such an impasse in the post-war years, I might have continued to think of myself as a cosmopolitan activist of Jewish origin, rather than a Jewish intellectual with cosmopolitan tastes. Had not the post-war years forced upon reflective men and women some major reconsiderations, the feelings of jewishness that were starting to reappear might have remained dormant.
</p><p> But because a rotten, immoral world capitalism has shaped the era since'the Short Twentieth Century', socialists are again confronted with the question of how to respond to nationalism.
</p><p> At the heart of all my books on historical topics I have tried to grapple with the themes of nationalism and internationalism. Because Scotland has always been a sorth of 'Third World country' in the midst of the fabulous wealth of the Anglo-Scottish ruling class squeezed out of the British Empire, I have found it much easier to identify with Third World historians, thinkers and writers like C.L.R. James, George Padmore and Edward Said than their metropolitan counteraparts. As a Scot and an oppositional socialist internationalist, I can empathise with Said's statement in his book <i>Culture and Imperialism</i> that:
</p><p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
The theme I take up is the uneasy relationship between nationalism and liberation, two ideals or goals for people engaged against imperialism. 
</p><p> Moreover, in rejecting a simplistic nationalism (as distinct from a sympathetic socialist internationalism), I accept Said's argument that 'the "strong" or "perfect" person achieves indepdence and detachment by working through attachments, not by rejecting them.'
</p><p> Provoked and stimulated into writing this book by Paul Smith, and inspired by Edward Said to put the history of the Scottish radical culture into an internationalist context, I present <i>The Very Bastards of Creation</i> as part of one Scot's critique of Western imperialism inside the Celtic fringe of Great Britain. In doing so, I wish to emphasise my solidarity with the Edward Said who insists that:
</p><p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
No one today is purely one thing. Labels like Indian, or woman, or Muslim, or American are no more than starting-points, which if followed into actual experience for only a moment are quickly left behind. Imperialism consolidated the mixture of cultures and identities on a global scale. But its worst and most paradoxical gift was to allow people to believe that they were only, mainly, or exclusively, white, black, or Western, or Oriental.
</p><p> Far from suffering any anguish about the Scots being made up of 'the refuse of the world', I celebrate the internationalism of this racial mixture. I am proud to be one of the very bastards of creation. Furthermore, I am very conscious of the paradox of the fact that, having spent most of my life as a socialist internationalist denouncing Scots and Scotland, I have increasingly had to defend some of the Scots cultural and radical traditions against a strident ageless, sexless, nationless and immoral international capitalism and imperialism. To counter the anti-humaism of late twentieth-century capitalism, I offer my readers this small book of reflections and history of the radical culture of the Athens of the North. 
</p><p> The rescue and historical excavation of the Scottish radical poets, writers and agitators from 'the enormous condescension of posterity' will not be welcomed by those who are now fostering a worldwide capitalist counter-revolution. However, in new circumstances where nationalism dominates contemporary politics for ill and sometimes good and Branka Magas's book <i>The Destruction of Yugoslavia</i> documents the inhumanity of the Serb fascists, it remains essential to make distinctions among different types of nationalism. Detailing some contemporary 'socialist' attitudes to nationalism, Magas complains about 'A repugnance at nationalism that makes no distinction between mobilisation behind an expansionary chauvinist project and mobilisation in defence of national sovereignty - even national existence - under military assault.'
</p><p> Towards the end of 'the terrible hell of the twentieth century', it has become increasingly difficult for socialists to discuss nationalism in a rational or dispassionate tone. It is even more difficult to get access to a media that is willing to debate the socialist alternative to the barbarism of our times. But humankind is already beinning to stir and international Labour will soon resume its pilgrimage towards the Primsed Land. The author hopes that this book will make a small contribution to the resumption of humakind's unending and undefeated struggle for the better world to come. 
</p><p> Since I developed heart disease and cancer in 1990, I have spent more of my leisure time with poets and literary men like Farquhar McLay, the ditor of the best-selling <i>Workers' City</i>, Freddie Anderson, the Irish-Scottish poet and novelist, and John Manson, the gifted poet and translator, rather than with academic historians. Anderson and Manson have led me into the obscure byways of Scottish literary history; and they have been a constant souce of encouragement and inspiration. They have also taught me the importance of moderate amounts of 'wine and bread' as a pre-condition for being on the side of the exploited and the unprivileged spirituously as well as spiritually, though Manson is sometimes a teetotaler. 
</p><p> Of the radicals portrayed in this book, James Barke and R.F. Mackenzie were the only two that I ever met. When I was a full-time student at Newbattle Abbey College, Dalkeith, during the year 1952-1953 Willa Muir would not allow either Hugh macDiarmid or James Barke into the College. But Barke's cousin was a cook at the College; and on a dark Friday night in 1952, he was smuggled into the servants' quarter. He gave his student admirers some fine malt whisky, and he entertained as well as instructed us on Scotland's hidden cultural history. 
</p><p> I also met and became a close friend of R.F. Mackenzie. In 1968 I taught history and English at Braehead Junior Secondary School for a couple of months, while he struggled to survive as the Headmaster against an increasingly hostile Labour Establishment. Open-minded, compassionate and radical, he came to lecture on the awful history of Scottish education to my History students at the University of Stirling in the 1970s and early 1980s. He was a democrat of democrats; and, in using some of his private letters to me with the permission of his wife Diana, in the chapter on A.S. Neill and R.F. Mackenzie, I hope to convey something of the man's rich humanity and simplicity. 
</p><p> In Glasgow Donald Anderson, a fine teacher and historian, has given me rare books and pamphlets on obscure aspects of Schottish history. Encouraging me to be proud of my Celtic origins, he has taken over the role of Hugh MacDiarmid as the guardian of the Scottish national question from the standpoint of socialist internationalism. 
</p><p> Moreover, Sir Ken Alexander encouraged me to complete this book, and he very generously acted as a referee when I applied to the Scottish Arts Council for a research grant. And in London the young historian Jim Clayson has worked on my behalf to search out rare pamphlets on eighteenth-century British radicalism. Moreover, the incomparable Peter Freyer has spent many hours in the British Library digging out references that I would not have otherwise been able to obtain without more trips to London. Peter also read the chapters of <i>The Very Bastards of Creation</i> and advised me about pruning them of irrelevancies and clumsy phrases. I am proud to have him as a friend. I also owe particular debts of encouragement to Gerry Cairns, Tommy kayes of Clydeside Press, Dr. Raymond Challinor, Rita Boyd, Anne and Jim Boyd-Thomas, Lorn Macintry, Ben and Cathie McGinn, Roseanna McKenna, Heather Valencia, Stan Bell, the fine Scottish socialist protester and Christian, Dr. Bob Purdie, John Copper, John Cooper, Junior, Robert Lynn, Phil McPhee, Hamish Henderson, Brian Quail of Scottish CND, Dr. Arnold and mary Kloper, Heather Valencia, John Manson, Andre Molyneux, Willie Maley, Bobby Lynn, Paul Buhle, Kent Worcester, Franklin and Penny Rosemont, Ray Burnett, Donal Mooney, editor of the <i>Irish Post</i> and Harry Reid, deputy editor of <i>The Herald</i>. And a special word of thanks to Alasdair Gray, author of <i>Lanark</i> and other fine novels for illustrating the covers of <i>The Very Bastards of Creation</i>, and to Harry Reid for contributing his foreword. 
</p><p> I have been helped by Kent Worcester, Edna Coleman, Richard Greeman, Paul Buhle, Penny and Franklin Rosemont, Phyllis and Julius Jacobson, Martin Glaberman, Jim Murray of the C.L.R. James Institute, New York, and many other American radicals. And at home I have been encouraged by my wife <i>Lorna</i>, my daughter <i>Alison</i> and my son <i>David</i> and his American wife <i>Marta</i> Stitenberger-Young. Finally, no man - or woman - is an island and collective mutual aid remains a precondition for civilised life; and it is with pleasure that I acknowledge research grants from the Scottish Arts Council, the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland and the Barry Amiel and Norman Melburn Trust.

<h2 id="chapter1"> Chapter One <br> <b>Scottish Nationalism and Plebian Radicalism 1707-1832</b> </h2>
<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
It is easy to make enemies; the difficult thing is to keep them. <br> <i> William Dean Howells </i> 
</p>
<h3> <b> The Union of 1707, the Jacobites and the Scottish Radicals.</b> </h3>
<p> Scotland lost her independence in 1707. This was the single most important factor in shaping Scottish radicalism. Scotland became, in the fine phrases of the Scottish novelist John Galt, 'a wrong-resenting country' and the Scots a 'history-conscious' people. 
</p><p> The nominal retention of the 'independence' of the Church did not survive for very long' and the 'independence' of the legal system was a farce. At the same time the Scottish universities increasingly became institutions through which systematic attempts were made to get rid of Gaelic and lallans by imposing the English language. A development initially fostered from within Scotland itself, it had been encouraged by the English ruling class in the wake of the Union of 1707. And, despite the very complicated role of the Scottish Englithenment intelligentsia in fostering a British consciousness throughout the Athens of the North, the English ruling class repeatedly displayed their colonial attitudes towards the Americans and the Scots. 
</p><p> Jacobitism and Scottish radicalism developed a symbiotic relationship. In 1708 the Jacobite troubles of that year led to the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act; Fletcher of Saltoun and Lord Belhaven were arrested, taken off and imprisoned in England.<sup><a href="#footnote#1.1">[1]</a></sup> As a result of the Jacobite rebellions of 1715 and 1745, the traitorous Jacobites in Scotland were taken to England for trial and execution.<sup><a href="#footnote#1.2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p> The colonial dimension was real and tangible. In 1711 an English politican aby the name of Harley expressed the colonial mentality of the ruling class by asking his fellow members of Parliament: 'Have we not bought the Scots, and may we not claim the right to tax them?<sup><a href="#footnote#1.3">[3]</a></sup> For what end, pray, did we give the Equivalent?' Furthermore, the English historian Thomas B. Macaulay Wrote:
</p><p style="margin-Left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
The British Legislature violated the Aritcles of Union, and made a change in the Constitution of the Church of Scotland. Year after year the General Assembly protested against the violation, but in vain; and from the Act of 1712 undoubtedly flowed every Secession and Schism in the Church of Scotland<sup><a href="#footnote#1.4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p> Moreover, in circumstances where the Scots were effectively disenfranchised from the decision-making process at Westminster, Morrison Davidson's observation in <i>Leaves from The Book of Scots (1914)</i> was salient: 'Until the Reform Bill of 1832, to talk of Franchies Extension in Scotland was a criminal offence of the deepest dye, as many a worthy Scot found to be his undoing'.<sup><a href="#footnote#1.5">[5]</a></sup>  
</p>
<h3><b>A Very Scottish Radicalism and English Chauvinism</b></h3>
<p> Unlike the eighteenth-century English radicals, the Scots did not feel anything like the same reverence, respect or awe for the institutions inside the Palace of Westminster or 'the principles of the glorious English revolution' of 1688. (It was significant that R.B. Cunninghame Grama, the Scottish Socialist, was the first member of Parliament to be expelled from the House of Commons for using the un-Parliamentary swear word 'damn').<sup><a href="#footnote#1.6">[6]</a></sup> There were many specific reasons for this lack of reverence, and some of them were rooted in Scottish history before the Union of Parliaments of 1707. In his authoritative book <i>English Constitutional History</i>, the British historian S.B. Chrimes identified the basic political differences between England and Scotland in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when he said: 'In Scotland the monarchy had always been decidedly weaker than it had been in England; armed resistance to the Crown had been commoner than in England.'<sup><a href="#footnote#1.7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p> But, although these particular political and cultural sediments of the past helped to fashion Scottish resentments and greivances after 1707, new anti-Scottish forces continued to develop throught the remainder of the eighteenth century. In his excellent essay on 'A Very English Socialism', royden Harrison argued that 'Egnlish working-class consciousness was shaped to an unusual degree not just by experience at the point of production, but by the experience of Parliament and the prolonged struggle for Parliamentary reform'.<sup><a href="#footnote#1.8">[8]</a></sup> What he did not understand was the very different development of Scottish radicalism - and socialism - from the 1790s.
</p><p> Moreover, in the twentieth century the British Left have been unusually hostile to the exposition of the view that Scottish radical history was simply different. When popular Scottish radicalism 'exploded' in the 1790s, the well-established English tradition of anti-Scottishness inhibited the development of 'British' radicalism. In his book <i>Radical Pioneers of the Eighteenth Century (1886)</i> the irish historian J. Bowles Daly said: 'The Scotch were considered foreigners and Jacobiets, entirely wanting in sympathy with the principles of the Revolution.'<sup><a href="#footnote#1.9">[9]</a></sup> The Scots were therefore irrelevant to the English radical project. Although they did not mention it, the Scottish Enlightenment intellectuals' enthusiasm for 'the principles' of 1688 was not shared by many of the 'lower orders'. 
</p><p> Obscured and hidden by the dominant Unionist historiography of the Right and the Left, the Scots were effectively disenfranchised from the Palace of Westminster until well after 1832. However, it was left to the now neglected nineteenth-century Irish historian W.E.H. Lecky to identify the Scots' colonial relationship to 'Great Britain'. As he put it:
</p><p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
The character of the Scotch members was lowered by the fact that for many years after the Union they alone received regular wages for their attendance in Parliament, their greater poverty exposed them specially to temptation, and one of the worst effects of the Union on <i>imperial politics</i> was the great accession it gave, in both Houses, to the corrupt influence of the Crown. It was, indeed, the custom in England to regard the Scotch as the most slavish and venal of politicians, and the reproach was not wiped away till the Reform Bill of 1832 created a real representation.<sup><a href="#footnote#1.10">[10]</a></sup>
</p><p>In contrast to the English experience, eighteenth-century Scottish 'working-class' or plebeian consciousness was largely shaped at the point of production and in the clubs and debating societies. The English and the Scots - or vice versa - did not like each other. As Lecky put it: 'In spite of their admirable education, in spite of their Protestantism, in spite of their growing industry, the aspect of the Scotch population in the latter years of the eighteenth century was still extremely repulsive to an English eye.'<sup><a href="#footnote#1.11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p>In <i>The Making of the English Working Class</i>, E.P. Thompson asserted that English and Scottish 'trade unions were impermanent and immature' until the 1820s.<sup><a href="#footnote#1.12">[12]</a></sup> But he, too, ignored the strong evidence of the English radicals' contempt for the Scots. This antagonism was reciprocated; but there was na important difference - the English ruling class had the political power to subdue its neighbour in the North. Moreover, when a new and more 'democratic' plebeian radicalism began to emerge in England from the 1760s onwards, it was deeply antagonistic towards the Scots.
</p><p> Identifying John Wilkes as a representative figure of 'the forces making for political reform', E.P. Thompson was silent about Wilkes's role in inhibiting a real British radicalism. For, although 'That Devil Wilkes' became and remained one of the 'heroes' of the English Left, he was an out-and-out chavinist.<sup><a href="#footnote#1.13">[13]</a></sup> An advocate of Parliamentary reform and in 1774 a supporter of the Americans' claim to independence, he nevertheless south to stir up violent passions against the Scots.
</p><p>At various times a friend of David Hume, James Boswell and Dr. Samuel Johnson, Wilkes was an English chauvinist who hated Scotland and the Scots. On good terms with Scots who personified the Enlightenment, he had been delighted in 1754 when Hume told him in a private letter that: 'Notwithstanding all the Pains, which I have taken in the Study of the English language, I am still jealous of my Pen. As to my tongue, you have seen that I regard it as totally desperate and Irreclaimable'.<sup><a href="#footnote#1.14">[14]</a></sup>
</p><p>Perhaps Wilkes' anti-Scottish prejudices were not helped by the cultural obseqiousness he encountered in Scots like Hume and Boswell.
</p><p>From 1763 when he first published <i>The North Briton</i>, Wilkes perfected what can be best described as racist stereotypes. As J. Bowles Daly explained:
</p><p style="margin-Left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
Wilkes used the plainest words to disclose the most discreditable dees, and was most vehement in his abuse of Scotland. Playing on the popular jealousy of foreigners and Scotsmen, he said, "that the River Tweed was the line of demarcation between all that was noble and all that was base - south of the river was all honour, virtue, and patriotism - north of it was nothing but lying, malice, meanness and slavery. Scotland is a treeless, flowerless land, formed out of the refuse of the universe, and inhabited by the very bastards of creation".<sup><a href="#footnote#1.15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p> In the January 1763 issue of <i>The North Briton</i>, Wilkes published 'The Prophecy of Famine: A Scots Pastoral' by the English poet Charles Churchill. In another issue he published Chuchill's epigram:
</p><p style="margin-Left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
No flower embalms the air but one white rose <br> which <br> on the tenth of June by instinct blows.<sup><a href="#footnote#1.16">[16]</a></sup>
</p><p>To decode Churchill's anti-Scottish epigram: the white rose was the Stuart flower; the 10th of June was the Pretender's birthday; and it was a stock English joke that the climate of Scotland was so hars that flowers would hardly ever grow there. Moreover, considering that Wilkes's friends like Hume were anti-Jacobites belonging to the 'higher ranks', it was obvious that he was an opportunist politican of the Left.
</p>
<h3><b> "That Devil Wilkes", English Chauvinism, and the Scottish Response </b></h3>
<p>The English were, as my old friend Ralphael Samuel always reminds us, a very special people - free-born with a superior language and more personal and general liberty than people in any other countries.<sup><a href="#footnote#1.17">[17]</a></sup> But, although they were reluctant to extend that liberty to the Scots, the Irish, the Americans or other 'inferior' peoples within the Empire, 'That Devil Wilkes' has always been regarded as the major, if transitional pioneer of 'British' radicalism. As Gwyn Williams explained:
</p><p style="margin-Left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
But Englishmen often had a more specific 'warrant'; they were freeborn Englishmen whose right of resistance had been confirmed in 1688. Before the city of London acquired a radical temper and before the John Wilkes imbrogilo, most city riots were obscurely 'traditionalist'; a defence of 'natural' order against the Constitution's myriad enemies (hence possibly the 'No Popery!' of Birmingham in 1791).<sup><a href="#footnote#1.18">[18]</a></sup>
</p><p> But that was the rub - the overwhelming majority of Scots were regarded in England as the potentially militant enemies of the Constitution of 1688. 
</p><p> Ignored by the historians of British, English or Scottish radicalism, the most important 'radical' incident of the eighteenth century was what happened in 1768. In his excellent old-fashioned book <i>The Reign of George III, 1760-1815</i> J. Steven Watson wrote: 
</p><p style="margin-Left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
Once Wiles was in prison his power to arouse excitement as a martyr was much increased. His partisans excited all the anti-ministerial passion of the time. On 10th May 1768 troops round the prison in St. George's Files were involved in a skirmish with crowds who had come to draw Wilkes in triumph from his cell to Parliament. In this a spectator, a Mr. William Allen, was killed. It was unfortunate that the troops were the Scots Guards - countrymen of Bute... He [Wilkes] proceeded to publish letters on the riots, accusing the Mnistry of using Scottish butchers to intimidate free Englishmen. <sup><a href="#footnote#1.19">[19]</a></sup>
</p><p> An indication of the English ruling class's awareness of their colonial relationship with the Scots, the employment of Scottish troops was, though indeed unfortunate, not at all accidental.
</p><p> The English chauvinism unleashed by this incident was to feed and sustain the half-hidden, inarticulate, sullen and embarassed nationalism of most Scots for a long time afterwards. The English racism encouraged by Wilkes provoked an extraordinary reaction from David Hume and James Boswell. While the better-known <i>British</i> Hume of the Scottish Enlightenment, whose generally pro-British outlook was unusually consistent, expressed his almost unbelievable Scottish nationalist sentiments on at least one rare occasion in a very private letter to his Scottish publisher A. Millar. Modern nationalist historians have therefore portrayed Hume as anti-English. One One exceptional occasion, Hume said: 
</p><p style="margin-Left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
The rage and prejudice of parties frighten me, above all the rage against the Scots, which is so dishonourable, and indeed, so infamous to the English nation. We hear that it increases every day, without the least appearance of provocation on our part. It has frequently made me resolve never in my life to set foot on English ground. Nothing but a rebellion will open the eyes of that deluded [English] people; though were they alone concerned, I think it is of no matter what becomes of them... Oh!, how I long to see America and the East Indies revolt, totally and finally - the revenue reduced to half - public credit discredited by bankruptcy - the third of London in ruins.<sup><a href="#footnote#1.20">[20]</a></sup>
</p><p> Unfortunately, although Scottish nationalist historiographers, whether ancient or modern, quoted what Hume and Boswell said about the anti-Scottish sentiments expressed by the English in 1762 and in 1768, they did not menion Wilkes or even try to put those incidents into context. In his book <i>Leaves from the Book of Scots</i>, the Scottish nationalist Davidson misrepresented Hume by saying that he 'shared to the full the bitter antipathies of his Scottish countrymen'.<sup><a href="#footnote#1.21">[21]</a></sup> However, Hume's transitory statement of 1768 was an aberration; and if his nationalism had been so consistent as Davidson said, the whole history of Scottish nationalism and radicalism would have been very different.
</p><p> Davidson was an industrious and talented partisan, not a trained historian. Instead of making the most of the extreme anti-Scottishness of Wilkes and the reaction it provoked in Boswell's head, nationalist historians have mentioned neither the consistent English chauvinism of Wilkes nor the equally transitory Scottish nationalism of Boswell. 
</p><p> In his conversations with both Wilkes and Dr. Johnson in 1773, the latter told Boswell: 
</p><p style="margin-Left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
The Irish mix better with the English than the Scotch do; their language is nearer to English; as proof of which they succeed very well as players, which Scotsmen do not. Then, Sir, they have not that extreme nationality which we find in the Scotch. I will do you, Boswell, the justice to say, that you are the most <i>unscottified</i> of your countrymen. You are almost the only instance of a Scotsman that I have known, who did not at every other sentence bring in some other Scotsman.<sup><a href="#footnote#1.22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p> But an even more relevant conversation between Wilkes, Johnson and Boswell took place in London in the fateful year of 1776. Despite Wilkes's earlier description of the Scots as 'the bastards of creation', Boswell recalled that:
</p><p style="margin-Left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
Upon this [anti-Scottishness] Johnson and Mr. Wilkes could perfectly assimilate; here was a bond of union between them, and I was conscious that both of them were fully satisfied of the strange narrow ignorance of those who imagine that Scotland is a land of famine. But they amused themselves with persevering in the old jokes.<sup><a href="#footnote#1.23">[23]</a></sup>
</p><p> A defender of the Union of 1707 and Britishness, Boswell was a most unlikely Scottish nationalist.
</p><p> But in the privacy of <i>Boswell's London Journal</i>, he (Johnson's later biographer) had, in 1762, reacted to the 'chauvinism of the English by objecting to the behaviour of a Convent Garden audience who greeted the presence of some Highland officers with the cry of "No Scots. Out with them!"' Then he wrote:
</p><p style="margin-Left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
My heart warmed to my countrymen, my Scottish blood boiled with indignation. I jumped on the benches, roared out, 'Damn you, you rascals!', hissed and was in a great rage... I hated the English; I wished from my soul that the Union was broke and that we might give them another battle of Bannockburn.<sup><a href="#footnote#1.24">[24]</a></sup>
</p><p> Ignoring the fact that Boswell did not protest in newspapers or magazines, the professional (Scottish nationalist) historian Harry Hanham from New Zealand misread this comment in <i>Boswell's London Journal</i> when he wrote: 'The significant thing about this sensitivity to supposed insults to Scotland was that it was marked among those who championed the Union of 1707 as among those who regretted it.'<sup><a href="#footnote#1.25">[25]</a></sup> But if Boswell and Hume had not been so inhibited by their already national cultural schizophrenia and had written - or spoken - against the English chauvinist dimension that was crystal-clear in 1762 and 1768, the whole history of Scottish nationalism and radicalism would have developed very differently.
